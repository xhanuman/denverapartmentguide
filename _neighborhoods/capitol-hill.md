Capitol Hill (often referred to as "Cap Hill" by locals) is one of Denver's oldest and most vibrant neighborhoods, located just east of the downtown area. Known for its historic mansions, diverse apartment options, and bustling urban atmosphere, Capitol Hill offers a unique blend of old-world charm and modern city living.

The neighborhood gets its name from the Colorado State Capitol Building, which sits at its western edge. The gold-domed landmark, completed in 1894, remains one of the area's defining features and offers free tours to visitors interested in Colorado's political history.

## History

Capitol Hill's development began in the late 19th century when wealthy gold and silver miners, railroad barons, and oil magnates built mansions in the area. The neighborhood was home to many of Denver's elite, including the "Unsinkable" Molly Brown, whose historic house is now a museum.

As Denver grew throughout the 20th century, many of the grand homes were converted into apartments, and new multi-unit buildings were constructed. This transformation created the diverse housing landscape that exists today, with historic mansions alongside mid-century apartment buildings and modern developments.

## Housing Options

Capitol Hill offers a wide range of rental options, from studios in converted Victorian homes to modern luxury apartments. The neighborhood is known for its architectural diversity, with Queen Anne, Romanesque, and Neoclassical styles represented among its historic buildings.

Rental prices in Capitol Hill tend to be slightly below the Denver average, making it an attractive option for young professionals, students, and artists. However, the most desirable units in historic buildings or newly renovated properties command premium prices.

Many apartments in the area feature unique architectural details like high ceilings, hardwood floors, and ornate moldings. However, older buildings may lack amenities like in-unit laundry, central air conditioning, or off-street parking, which are important considerations for potential renters.

## Community and Culture

Capitol Hill has long been known as one of Denver's most diverse and inclusive neighborhoods. The area has a rich LGBTQ+ history and continues to be a welcoming community for people of all backgrounds.

The neighborhood has a distinctly bohemian character, with a thriving arts scene, independent businesses, and politically engaged residents. Community events like the People's Fair and PrideFest draw large crowds to nearby Civic Center Park each year.

Capitol Hill is also home to several cultural institutions, including the Kirkland Museum of Fine & Decorative Art, the Molly Brown House Museum, and the Denver Art Museum in the adjacent Golden Triangle neighborhood.

## Lifestyle

Life in Capitol Hill is decidedly urban, with the convenience of walkable streets, abundant public transportation, and proximity to downtown. The neighborhood's central location makes it ideal for those who work in the city center or want easy access to Denver's major attractions.

The area is particularly popular with young professionals and creative types who appreciate its vibrant nightlife, diverse dining options, and artistic atmosphere. Capitol Hill has one of Denver's youngest populations, with a median age several years below the city average.

Residents enjoy the neighborhood's many coffee shops, which serve as popular remote working spots, as well as its eclectic mix of restaurants, ranging from casual diners to upscale eateries. The area's bars and music venues keep the neighborhood lively well into the evening hours, especially on weekends.

## Green Spaces

Despite its urban density, Capitol Hill offers several green spaces for residents to enjoy. Cheesman Park, at the neighborhood's eastern edge, provides 80 acres of open space with jogging paths, a pavilion, and spectacular mountain views. The adjacent Denver Botanic Gardens offers a peaceful retreat with 24 acres of plants from around the world.

Governor's Park, though smaller, is another popular spot for picnics and outdoor relaxation. Civic Center Park, just west of the Capitol Building, hosts numerous events throughout the year and features formal gardens, fountains, and monuments.

## Final Thoughts

Capitol Hill offers a unique urban living experience that combines historic charm with modern convenience. Its central location, diverse housing options, and vibrant atmosphere make it one of Denver's most sought-after rental neighborhoods, particularly for those seeking an authentic city lifestyle.

While the neighborhood does face challenges like parking limitations and higher population density, these are offset by its walkability, cultural amenities, and strong sense of community. For renters who value being in the heart of Denver's action, Capitol Hill remains an excellent choice.
